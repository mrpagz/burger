# eatdaburger
### Overview

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express and an ORM.

### Concept

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of their favorite burgers!

Whenever a user submits their burger, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Each burger on the right side of the page will have a Delete Button. When the user clicks delete, it will be removed from the database and the page.
